Quick Kaggle competition to familiarize myself with both Kaggle and some binary classification techniques. I used kSVM at first, which is one that I have been using recently. kSVM 
yielded results that weren't great. Then, I implemented a neural network in Pytorch that used Binary Cross Entropy loss and outputted raw logits. The logits were passed into
the sigmoid function to output the probability of being class 1 (rain).
